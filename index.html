                                    Greetings,
        
                                    I’m Sercan Külcü, an assistant professor in the computer science department at Giresun University. I am also a passionate software engineer with a Ph.D. in wireless communications. In addition to my research, I have been teaching OOP and Java courses since 2015. I also have experience teaching a variety of software engineering topics, including object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures, and algorithms.
                                    
                                    Warm regards,
